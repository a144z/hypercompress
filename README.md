## 🧪 Compression Techniques

Hypercompress implements a multi-stage hybrid compression pipeline combining multiple techniques:

### 1. Low-Rank Approximation (LRA)
Factorizes weight matrices using singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce parameter count while preserving performance. Can be applied as weight-level compression or structural factorization (see [Pipeline Architecture](#-compression-pipeline-architecture)).

### 2. KV-Cache Distillation
Compresses key-value cache projections to reduce memory footprint during inference and transfer knowledge from teacher to student models.

### 3. Byte Latent Transformers (BLT)
Structural compression of embedding layers by replacing high-dimensional embeddings with low-dimensional latent representations. Runs first in the pipeline to structurally modify the model.

### 4. Sparsity Acceleration
Prunes weights to achieve extreme sparsity ratios (up to 99%+) while maintaining model accuracy through careful weight selection.

### 5. Structural Compression
Replaces linear layers with factorized equivalents to achieve true parameter reduction. This is the key technique that actually reduces model size (not just "effective" compression).

### 6. Knowledge Distillation
Teacher-student training transfers knowledge from large models to compressed students through hierarchical LoRA updates and activation alignment.

> **Note**: For detailed information on how these techniques work together in the pipeline, see the [Compression Pipeline Architecture](#-compression-pipeline-architecture) section.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Compression runs are configured via YAML files. Example:

```yaml
mode: hybrid
targets:
  compression_ratio: 1000
  retained_accuracy: 0.95
branches:
  lra:
    rank: 64
    sparsity: 0.99
  kv:
    cache_tokens: 128
  blt:
    embedding_reduction: 0.9
  sparsity:
    target_sparsity: 0.99
logging:
  experiment: sample-hybrid
```

See `configs/default.yaml` for a complete reference of all available options.

## 📊 Compression Reporting

Every pipeline run produces a `CompressionSummary` that aggregates:

- Branch-level compression ratios
- Parameter statistics (before/after)
- Target compliance tracking
- Per-branch attribution metrics

Results are automatically logged to TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, or custom dashboards under the `compression/*` namespace.

## 🏗️ Compression Pipeline Architecture

Hypercompress implements a multi-phase compression pipeline designed to achieve extreme compression ratios while maintaining model performance.

### Pipeline Execution Order

The compression pipeline follows a carefully orchestrated sequence to maximize compression effectiveness:

#### Phase 1: Structural Compression (First)
**Byte Latent Transformers (BLT)** runs first to structurally compress embeddings:
- Replaces `Embedding(V, D)` → `Embedding(V, r) + Linear(r, D)`
- Updates `lm_head` to match: `Linear(D, V)` → `Linear(D, r) + Linear(r, V)`
- **Why first**: Must run before other branches modify the model structure

#### Phase 2: Weight-Level Compression
Multiple branches run concurrently to compress model weights:

1. **Low-Rank Approximation (LRA)**: Computes SVD-based approximations of weight matrices
2. **KV-Cache Distillation**: Compresses key-value projection weights
3. **Sparsity**: Prunes weights to achieve high sparsity ratios (up to 99%+)

#### Phase 3: Merge
- Blends compressed weights from all branches
- Loads merged weights into the student model

#### Phase 4: Structural Factorization
**Structural LRA** replaces linear layers with factorized equivalents:
- `Linear(in, out)` → `Linear(in, r) + Linear(r, out)`
- **Result**: Actual parameter count reduction (increases `param_ratio`)

#### Phase 5: Final Model
The compressed model contains:
- ✅ Structurally compressed embeddings (from BLT)
- ✅ Factorized linear layers (from structural LRA)
- ✅ Pruned weights (from sparsity)
- ✅ Low-rank approximations (from LRA/KV merge)

### Key Design Principles

#### Aggressive Compression by Default
- For `target_ratio > 10.0`: Structural LRA automatically enables
- For `--ratio > 50`: Budget planner applies more aggressive settings:
  - LRA rank: Cut in half
  - KV cache tokens: Cut in half
  - BLT latent_dim: Cut in half
  - Sparsity: Increased by 5%

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Weight compression** (branches): Preserves structure, modifies weights
- **Structural changes** (dedicated steps): Actually reduces parameter count
- Clean execution order prevents interference between phases

### Expected Compression Results

#### Before Fixes:
```
param_ratio: 2.52x  (teacher 124M → student 49M)
blt: 1.00x          (not working - tied weight detection blocking compression)
effective: 9.15x    (metrics only, no real compression)
```

#### After Fixes (with `--ratio 100`):
```
param_ratio: 20-50x  (actual structural changes)
blt: 10-50x         (embeddings structurally compressed)
lra: 50-100x        (all Linear layers factorized)
effective: 100x+    (combined effect)
```

### Technical Fixes Implemented

#### 1. BLT Branch - Complete Rewrite
**Problem**: BLT was detecting tied weights and skipping ALL compression, returning 1.00x ratio.

**Solution**: 
- Removed tied-weight detection that blocked compression
- BLT now ALWAYS applies structural compression when enabled
- Simplified logic: structural mode OR projection-based mode
- No complex tied-weight handling that prevented compression

#### 2. Pipeline Execution Order
**Problem**: BLT ran after other branches, finding already-modified embeddings.

**Solution**:
- BLT runs FIRST (via branch registry order)
- Structural LRA runs AFTER merge in dedicated step
- Removed redundant embedding low-rank step that conflicted with BLT

#### 3. Budget Planner - More Aggressive
Automatically applies aggressive compression settings for high target ratios, ensuring the pipeline actually achieves the requested compression targets.

### Testing the Pipeline

To verify the compression pipeline is working correctly:

```bash
python scripts/run_hf_pipeline.py \
  --config configs/hf_fast_dev.yaml \
  --teacher-model gpt2 \
  --student-model distilgpt2 \
  --distill-data data/distill.txt \
  --finetune-data data/finetune.txt \
  --seq-len 128 \
  --stride 64 \
  --max-chunks 10 \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --ratio 100
```

**Expected output indicators**:
- BLT should show `>1.00x` (embeddings compressed)
- `param_ratio` should be `>10x` (actual model size reduction)
- Logs should show "Structurally replaced embedding..." messages
